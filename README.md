# learning-spotify-api-private
 rough draft - learning spotify api assignment

1. You should get the top tracks for Led Zeppelin, and the audio features for all those top
tracks.

    - This is implemented in 
    
    
2. You should get the related artists for Led Zeppelin, each of those artists’ top tracks, and
the audio features for each of those tracks.


3. You should pull the results together from all of the above into one dataframe.

4. Use one clustering technique to identify clusters of similar songs, and make a
recommendation for the optimal number of clusters from that technique (along with your reasons in the comments).
You may use any clustering technique that you think could be applied to this kind of data along with any or all of the features you just pulled down from the API. Note that we’re only looking for one technique and one final model (that technique with the number of clusters) here, and we don’t think there is any single “correct” model for this question.

5. Using this model, for each artist included, how many different clusters have at least one of their top tracks?
